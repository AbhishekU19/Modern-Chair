# Modern-Chair
Description:

In this project, I have designed and developed a visually stunning webpage to showcase a modern chair design. The main focus of the project was to create an engaging user experience through a sleek and modern user interface. The webpage has been carefully crafted to be responsive, ensuring seamless viewing on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Key Features:

Stylish Design: The webpage features a visually captivating design that highlights the modern chair's aesthetics. The use of clean lines, modern color palettes, and visually appealing elements creates an engaging and professional look.

Responsive Layout: To cater to a wide range of users, the webpage has been optimized for responsiveness. It adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring that users have a consistent and delightful experience across devices.

CSS Animations: The project utilizes CSS animations to add subtle and eye-catching effects to the webpage. These animations not only enhance the overall aesthetics but also provide a sense of interactivity to the design.

Interactive Elements: The webpage includes interactive elements such as buttons, hover effects, and smooth scrolling. These features elevate user engagement and navigation, making the user experience more enjoyable.

Code Structure: The HTML and CSS code have been organized and structured in a clean and maintainable manner, making it easy for others to understand, modify, and extend the project.

How to Use:
